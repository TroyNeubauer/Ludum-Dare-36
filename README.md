# Ludum-Dare-36
This is the game that I made for Ludum Dare 36. Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game development competition. The theme for LD 36 was Ancient Technology. I never really settled for a name (at the beginning of the 48 hours I called it Ancient arena then later I forgot about that and called it ancient adventurer). Basically in the game, you are a person living in 50,000 BC. You find a mysterious circle of rocks.You find another group of hunters and gatherers. You defeat them, then fight a barbarian king. When you defeat him, he curses you that you shall never age but also you shall never leave the arena. After that you fight other hunters and gatherers and you unlock new weapons as time progresses.
